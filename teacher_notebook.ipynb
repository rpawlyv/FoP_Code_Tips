    "## Overall Philosophy on the Course\n",
    "\n",
    "This course was designed to teach students the basics of data types, loops, conditionals, and the beginnings of Object-Oriented Programming which is indeed a solid foundation to grow from. Every topic in this course can be built on. Here are just some notes and summaries of the Modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Modules 1/2__\n",
    "\n",
    "These modules are all about the three basic types of data- Strings, integers, and floats, and learning how to identify, use, and convert them as needed. Students are also being taught _best practices_ on how to write variable names, the use of def main(): and main() and more. Note that some of the teachings we do counter Python's official style guide. For example, python uses underscores for variable/function names (movie_title vs movieTitle).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Module 3__\n",
    "\n",
    "Turtle is great Module for students to learn how to interact with a class (even though they don't know its one!), and it serves to create practical problems that the loops and created functions solve nicely. While we don't force students to create their own functions after this chapter, it is so important to understand the many small benefits in making them. People made the functions we use and eventually someone may use the functions our students make too! Great time to discuss the community aspect of coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Module 4__\n",
    "\n",
    "If statements and their partners are very intuitive to students as far as their usefulness goes, but the same can not be said of Lists. Iterating through Lists and other containers like it are without a doubt one of the most crucial things that needs to be known to complete many routine coding tasks. We continue on with looping through lists and Strings in Module 5 but the class doesn't do much to explain the new techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Module 5__\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of work we do on Classes and Object-Oriented Programming is but the tip of the iceberg, but the spirit of the idea is that Classes organize our code when we need functions to access common pieces of data. Imagine if you had to plug in where the turtle is, where its facing, and how fast its going everytime you want it to move forward! Classes solve problems like these and students should be encouraged to learn more about these after they finish here.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Module 6__\n",
    "\n",
    "The return keyword is discussed in 6.01, but really should have been in 3.04 if they could have fit it in. This is an essential piece to creating useful functions! The 6.01 assignment is a loose interpretation of a _unit test_, which is basically the only formal test that amateurs bother with."
